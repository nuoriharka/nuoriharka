# 🌀 nuoriharka — Independent Systems Architect

> *“Tao does nothing, yet leaves nothing undone.”*

This account hosts **operational and experimental systems** within the **Spektri / Spektre ecosystem**.

- **Spektri** (FI) — protocol & architecture  
- **Spektre** (EN) — the same system, different language surface  

The distinction is linguistic, not conceptual.

## 🧭 Focus

I design **systems that make decisions possible**.

My work focuses on failures that occur *before* decisions are made:
- misclassification of state  
- responsibility diffusion  
- narrative-driven execution  
- systems operating without explicit state ownership  

The objective is not optimization or persuasion, but **structural correctness under complexity**.

## 🧬 Core Architecture

### **Spektre Protocol v1.1**
A state-first protocol defining:
- explicit state ownership  
- state-before-interpretation  
- hard commit boundaries  
- responsibility as a technical invariant  

Spektre is not a philosophy or a product.
It is a **falsifiable protocol** for preventing catastrophic decisions by correcting the architecture that produces them.

---

### **Spektri-Genesis**
An experimental, continuously running substrate.

- living codebase  
- sandbox for emergent behavior  
- collective simulation and trust mechanisms  
- executable counterpart to the protocol  

**Protocol = lawbook**  
**Genesis = sandbox**

## 🧪 What Lives Here

This account is intentionally practical.

You’ll find:
- experimental code
- orchestration logic
- simulation substrates
- systems allowed to exist without promotion

Some projects are meant to run.
Some are meant to rest.
Not everything here is meant to be finished.

## 🧠 Principles

- State before narrative  
- Responsibility before automation  
- Structure before scale  
- Correctness over visibility
